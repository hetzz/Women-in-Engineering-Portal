                            <p >Despite the fact that women famously played a pioneering role in the 
                              early decades of programming and technology, the participation of women 
                              engineers in the technology sector globally still only stands at 26%, 
                              as per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The primary objective of this 
                              program is to address the gender imbalance in technology by grooming 
                              promising talent among women engineering students to advance and contribute 
                              to the field. Prioritising inclusion, the program is designed to support 
                              talented women engineers from under-privileged and disadvantaged backgrounds,
                                Designed by TalentSprint, supported by Google, this one-year experiential 
                                program aims to nurture 600 women college students over 3 years, of which
                                 100 will be in the first year. The program is a combination of summer 
                                 coding bootcamps, live online classes, ongoing mentorship, certification 
                                 and team-based projects to enhance problem solving and computational thinking. 
                                 It also provides exemplary participants a chance to get career opportunities at
                                  Google and its partners.</p>
